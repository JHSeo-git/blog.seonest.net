## New Blog Post Workflow

- If user says "new blog post" without topic/title: ask for topic/title first.
- Pick branch name: short slug from topic/title.
- Scaffold file: `content/blog/<slug>.mdx`.
- Frontmatter: only set title from user input; keep required placeholders minimal.
- No body content; no invented outline.
- Open editor: `cursor <new-post-path>`.
